Scripts for making and manipulating NEXUS files, along with some for 
dealing with input databases (such as from the INTF in MÃ¼nster).

The scripts were designed to work with my input data, and may not always work properly with other data. If it doesn't work, and you would like to help improve the software then please create an issue at https://github.com/edmondac/nexus_scripts/issues

Use a virtualenv built with the supplied requirements.txt

You'll need these installed:
 * libmysqlclient-dev (for Ubuntu)
 * python3.5-dev
 * graphviz libgraphviz-dev
